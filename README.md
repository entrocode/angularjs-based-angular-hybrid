# AngularJS Phone Catalog Tutorial Application


## Overview

Using the completed tutorial from: https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial I'm going to convert the project to webpack and add Angular (2) based components using the downgrade module.


## Prerequisites

### Git

- A good place to learn about setting up git is [here][git-setup].
- You can find documentation and download git [here][git-home].

### Node.js and Tools

- Get [Node.js][node].
- Install the tool dependencies: `npm install`


## Workings of the Application

- The application filesystem layout structure is based on the [angular-seed][angular-seed] project.
- There is no dynamic backend (no application server) for this application. Instead we fake the
  application server by fetching static JSON files.
- Read the _Development_ section at the end to familiarize yourself with running and developing
  an Angular application.
